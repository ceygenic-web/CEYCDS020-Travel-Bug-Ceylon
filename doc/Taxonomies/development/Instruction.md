Taxonomy Feature
Taxonomies are used to make product specifications that are not belong to categories and brands. 

- has 2 entities, Taxonomy , TaxonomyType 
Ex: here is a list of example for those 2 and how they relate
Target Audience -> e.g. Men, Women, Kids
Season -> e.g. Summer, Winter Collection.
Occasion -> e.g. Wedding, Office, Party.
Feature -> e.g. Waterproof, Organic, Handcrafted.


- so you have to create a feature where we can get list of taxonomies based on their type and all the CRUD operations. 
- create API, Services, Requests, Resources and models and migrations with even seeders and factories.
- once complete we can connect the products with taxonomies.
- - means taxonomy service should have methods to get products based on a taxonomy. get taxonomies of a particular product
- - product feature should be updated to include taxonomies with the product details when fetching data. 

Frontend
- there should be TS frontend service to handle crud operation API requesting parts. 
- then forms and tables that handle basic CRUD as components (Ex: taxonomy and type adding forms, listing tables, dropdown lists, updating and viewing¬†popup¬†modal¬†)

here is a clear example of taxonomies and taxonomy types

‚úÖ Here‚Äôs a clean **example list of taxonomy_types and taxonomies** suited for an advanced modular e-commerce system (like yours):

### üîπ Notes

* Brands & categories ‚Üí kept separately (as you already do).
* Variations (size, color, etc.) ‚Üí handled via variation and variation_options, not taxonomies.
* Taxonomies are perfect for *filtering, tagging, and product metadata classification*.

---

‚úÖ *Summary*

* Table 1 ‚Üí taxonomy_types: defines category kinds.
* Table 2 ‚Üí taxonomies: holds the actual hierarchical or flat values.

This setup will scale for *any e-commerce niche*, including fashion, electronics, cosmetics,¬†or¬†furniture
